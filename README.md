# CAAF: Compact Actor Archive Format

A **Compact Actor Archive Format** or **CAAF** for short is a binary archive format which is used to store all data required to render a 3D model in SDL3 using the GPU API as well as other optional data.  
This is **not** an official format and it is *currently in development* alongside a personal project.  
  
An editor for this file format is currently being developed in this repo as well.  
You can find the format documentation [here](caaf.md).
